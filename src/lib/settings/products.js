				},
				item3: {
					title: 'Protection from the Elements',
					content:
						'Asphalt shingles act as one of the primary components of your home, helping to facilitate the flow of water away from your home.

				},
				item5: {
					title: 'Added Curb Appeal',
					content:
						'When you choose traditional asphalt shingles to your home, you have a wide selection of styles, colors, and patterns to choose from.

					title: 'Wind Rating up to 130 MPH',
					content:
						'High winds can have a devastating effect on your roof, especially when you get winds higher than 100 miles per hour.

Not only can this result in roof repair, but it can also cause damage to the interior of your home, resulting in escalating repair bills. F-Wave Synthetic Shingles have been rated to withstand hurricane force winds of up to 130 miles per hour, so no matter what sort of Michigan storm comes through, you can rest easy knowing that your F-Wave roof can take the abuse.'
